### Prerequisites

Before you dive into the world of Windows customization, there are a few prerequisites that you'll need to have in place

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/).
You'll also need to install figlet-cli globally by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g figlet-cli
```

Finally, to make things much easier, we highly recommend that you download the Windows Terminal app from the Microsoft Store [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701).

### Usage

We can edit the PowerShell profile at `$profile` to run some startup commands

1. Make the scripts in [terminal-startup](terminal-startup) available globally:

   - Copy the scripts to some folder
   - Add this folder path to the path system variables
   - Check if it's working by typing the following commands in the terminal

     ```bash
     Write-FormattedText -help

     Write-Figlet -help
     ```

2. If you use windows terminal:
   - Create a new folder for scripts somewhere and create a new file with its name ending with ps1.
   - You can use the commands `Write-Figlet` and `Write-FormattedText` to generate the text you need. An example profile script is given [here](terminal-startup/Example-Profile.ps1)
   - Now, link this ps1 file to a profile in the terminal by editing the Command Line option in the profile settings: `powershell.exe -noprofile -noexit -command "invoke-expression '. ''<Path To The PS1 File>''' "`
